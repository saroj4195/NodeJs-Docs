# Booking Engine Lifecycle

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete lifecycle of a booking made through the Aura PMS Booking Engine. It covers the guest's journey from the initial search and discovery phase to post-stay engagement, detailing the key stages, user actions, and system interactions involved.

## 2. Pre-Booking Phase

This phase encompasses all activities a potential guest undertakes before they are ready to make a reservation. The primary goal is to provide a seamless, informative, and engaging user experience that leads to a booking.

### 2.1. Discovery and Search

*   **Action:** The guest arrives at the booking engine, either through a direct link, a marketing campaign, or the hotel's website.
*   **System Interaction:**
    *   The `get-hotel-info` API is called to load essential hotel data, including room types, rate plans, and amenities.
    *   The `auth` API authenticates the request and fetches company-specific configurations.
    *   The `calendar-rate-fetch` API is called to display a 60-day rate snapshot, providing an at-a-glance view of availability and pricing.

### 2.2. Exploration and Consideration

*   **Action:** The guest explores the available room types, packages, and experiences. They may also view photos, read descriptions, and check amenities.
*   **System Interaction:**
    *   The `get-package-list` and `get-experience-list` APIs are called to display available packages and experiences.
    *   The `get-package-details` and `get-experience-details` APIs provide detailed information on selected offerings.
    *   The `deal-of-the-day` API may be used to highlight special offers and value propositions.

### 2.3. Availability and Pricing Check

*   **Action:** The guest selects their desired dates, number of guests, and room type.
*   **System Interaction:**
    *   The `inventory-rate-fetch` API is called to get real-time availability and pricing for the selected criteria.
    *   The `tax-details` and `add-on-charges` APIs are called to calculate the total price, including taxes and any additional charges.

## 3. Booking Phase

This phase begins when the guest decides to make a reservation and proceeds to the checkout process.

### 3.1. Guest Information and Payment

*   **Action:** The guest enters their personal details (name, email, phone number) and selects a payment method.
*   **System Interaction:**
    *   The system validates the guest's information.
    *   If the guest chooses an online payment method (Prepaid or Partial), they are redirected to the payment gateway.
    *   For "Pay at Hotel" or "Bank Transfer," the booking is confirmed without immediate online payment.

### 3.2. Booking Confirmation

*   **Action:** The guest completes the booking process.
*   **System Interaction:**
    *   The `create-package-booking` or `create-experience-booking` API is called to create the reservation in the Aura PMS.
    *   The `voucher-generator` API is triggered to create and send a booking voucher to both the guest and the hotelier.
    *   The guest is automatically registered in the system using their phone number.

### 3.3. Post-Booking Engagement (Gamification)

*   **Action:** Immediately after the booking is confirmed, the guest is presented with a gamified element like a scratch card or a spin wheel.
*   **System Interaction:**
    *   The guest interacts with the element to reveal a reward.
    *   The reward could be loyalty points, a discount coupon for their next booking, or a complimentary add-on for their current stay (e.g., a free drink at the bar).
    *   The reward is automatically added to the guest's profile in the CRM and loyalty module.
*   **Benefit:** This provides instant gratification, increases guest engagement, and encourages repeat bookings.

## 4. Pre-Stay Phase

This phase covers the period between booking confirmation and the guest's arrival at the property. The goal is to build anticipation, provide useful information, and generate ancillary revenue.

### 4.1. Pre-Arrival Communication

*   **Action:** The guest receives a pre-arrival email with their booking details, hotel information, and any relevant travel tips.
*   **System Interaction:** The system can be configured to send automated pre-arrival emails at a specified time before check-in.
*   **Future Enhancement (Hyper-Personalization):** Instead of generic emails, the system will leverage CRM data to send highly personalized notifications. For example, for a returning guest, it might say, "Welcome back, [Guest Name]! We noticed you enjoyed the sea-view room last year. Would you like to book the same room again?"

### 4.2. Upselling and Cross-selling

*   **Action:** The guest may be offered opportunities to upgrade their room, purchase add-ons (e.g., spa treatments, airport transfers), or book experiences.
*   **System Interaction:** These offers can be included in pre-arrival emails or displayed in the "My Account" section of the booking engine.
*   **Future Enhancement (AI-Powered Recommendations):** An AI engine will analyze the guest's profile and booking details to offer the most relevant and enticing upsell opportunities. For example, offering a discounted suite upgrade with free gym access to a guest who has previously booked a deluxe room.

### 4.3. Online Check-in

*   **Action:** The guest may have the option to complete the check-in process online, providing their ID and other required documents.
*   **System Interaction:** This information is securely stored in the PMS, streamlining the check-in process upon arrival.

## 5. In-Stay Phase

This phase covers the guest's experience at the property, from check-in to check-out.

### 5.1. Check-in

*   **Action:** The guest arrives at the hotel and completes the check-in process.
*   **System Interaction:** The front office staff retrieves the guest's booking from the Aura PMS and completes the check-in process.

### 5.2. In-Room Services and Communication

*   **Action:** The guest can use in-room services (e.g., room service, laundry) and communicate with the hotel staff.
*   **System Interaction:** These requests are managed through the FOM (Front Office Management) module of the Aura PMS.

## 6. Post-Stay Phase

This phase begins after the guest has checked out and is focused on gathering feedback, encouraging repeat bookings, and fostering loyalty.

### 6.1. Check-out and Final Settlement

*   **Action:** The guest checks out of the hotel and settles any outstanding payments.
*   **System Interaction:** The front office staff completes the check-out process in the Aura PMS and generates the final invoice.

### 6.2. Feedback Collection

*   **Action:** The guest receives a post-stay email with a link to a feedback form or a review website.
*   **System Interaction:** The system can be configured to send automated post-stay emails. Guest feedback is collected and managed through the reputation management module.

### 6.3. Loyalty and Engagement

*   **Action:** The guest may receive targeted marketing emails with special offers for future stays.
*   **System Interaction:** The CRM module is used to manage guest data and send targeted marketing campaigns. If a loyalty program is in place, the guest's account is updated with any points or rewards they have earned.
*   **Future Enhancement (Proactive Engagement):** After a stay, the CRM can trigger personalized offers for future bookings based on the guest's recent experience. For example, if a family enjoyed the pool, they might receive an offer for a "family fun" package on their next visit.
