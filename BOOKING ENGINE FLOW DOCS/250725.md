3. **Multi-Property Logic**: `hotels_by_company` retrieves other hotels listed under the same company.
4. **Tax & Add-ons**: Calls for `tax-details`, `add-on-charges`, and `paid-services` are made to prepare for pricing calculations.
5. **Availability Calendar**: Rates for 60 days are pulled via `calendar-rate-fetch` to show availability.
6. **Deal Highlighting**: `deal-of-the-day` API compares internal prices vs. OTA prices to highlight the value.
7. **Inventory Check**: On selection of date/room, `inventory-rate-fetch` gets real-time room availability and prices.
8. **Plugin Data**: The plugin detail API (`get-be-plugin-details`) fetches Booking Engine-specific configurations.
