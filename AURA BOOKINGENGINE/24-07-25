# Final, Consolidated Booking Engine Implementation Plan

## Part 1: Core Principles & Architecture

*   **Core Principle: Instant Booking:** All bookings are confirmed automatically and in real-time, based on live availability from the `oco` module.
*   **Unified Architecture:** The booking engine will be a single, new "app" module located at `src/apps/booking-engine`. It will contain logic for both the public-facing guest experience and the hotelier-facing management panel, organized into `guest/` and `management/` subdirectories.
*   **Direct Service Consumption:** The booking engine will directly inject and consume existing services from other `aura-pms` modules, primarily the `AriOrchestrator` and `ReservationOrchestrator` from the `oco` module.
